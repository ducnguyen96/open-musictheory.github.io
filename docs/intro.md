# Introduction

Inspired by [Open Music Theory](http://openmusictheory.com/) which contributed most contents of the project now.

Using [docusaurus](http://docusaurus.io/), a great open-source tool for building the website, we build this to help music theory be more accessible for learners around the world.

Contributions are welcome and we appreciate any translation, content, fixing errors of you guys.
