# Keyboard-style voice-leading schemata

Following are a number of _schemata_ for keyboard-style voice-leading. Some of these are patterns that are common enough to warrant special attention (and memorization). Others require non-default voice-leading or doublings. In any case, these are worth memorizing to assist both in composition/arranging and in recognition of standard patterns. (Some will also come in handy for chorale-style voice-leading.)

## Voice exchange

A _voice exchange_ occurs when the melody and bass lines exchange pitches over the course of a simple contrapuntal prolongation. For example, in the progression **T1 D2 T3**, the bass begins on _do_ and ends on _mi_. In a voice exchange, the melody would reverse this, starting on _mi_ and ending on _do_. This common pattern can use a **V<sup>6/4</sup>**, **V<sup>4/3</sup>**, or a **VII<sup>6/3</sup>** chord for **D2**:

Using this voice exchange pattern will ensure smooth voice-leading throughout the prolongation.

Note that the _fa_ in the **D2** passing chord (a functional dissonance) of the second example does _not_ resolve down to _mi_. This is permissible because _mi_ is required of the bass line but cannot be doubled, and because the smooth outer-voice counterpoint and stepwise inner-voice motion counteract any harshness perceived by the unresolved dissonance.

The voice exchange can also be used with a **D4** substitution chord. Note that the upper voices will be exactly the same as using a **V<sup>6/4</sup>** for **D2**.

These patterns can be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and the **D2** voice exchanges can be used in reverse, as well—**T3 D2 T1**. They can also be used to prolong S and D: **S4 T5 S6** or **D5 S6 D7**, for example.

## Parallel tenths

_Do–re–mi_ in the bass is also frequently accompanied by _mi–fa–sol_ in the melody, making _parallel tenths_.

Note here that, like the _fa_ in the **D2** voice exchange, the _fa_ in the melody is an unresolved functional dissonance. In this case, the voice leading once again is so smooth that it overrides the need for the functional dissonance to resolve.

This pattern can also be used in major or minor, transposed to any key, and in reverse. It almost always uses a **V<sup>4/3</sup>** for **D2**.

## Champagne progression

While **T(1 D2p 3)** is a perfectly acceptable way to accompany _mi–fa–sol_ in the melody, a more interesting (and also more involved) way to harmonize that melody is what theorist Gene Biringer called the _champagne progression_: **T1 S6 T3**. (He called it this because it is "the progression you use when you want to impress a date.")

The champagne progression is very nice, but must be treated carefully. _Only_ use it with _mi–fa–sol_ (or _me–fa–sol_) in the melody, and _always_ use the following voice-leading (note the non-standard doubling of the bass—_la_/_le_—in the **S6** chord).

The standard champagne progression (above) uses a **I<sup>6</sup>** chord for **T3**. Following is a variant using **III** for **T3**, which Biringer dubbed "pink champagne," because it is especially nice. It should also be especially _rare_, or it loses its punch.

## Deceptive resolution

A _deceptive resolution_ occurs When a **D5** (**V** or **V<sup>7</sup>**) chord does not progress, as expected, to **I** to form an authentic cadence, but instead progresses to **VI**. In the deceptive resolution, it is important for _ti_ to resolve to _do_—as it would in an authentic cadence—not _la_/_le_. This fulfills its role as a tendency tone, helps the "deception" to work, and avoids the dissonant augmented second _ti_–_le_ in minor. This results in a non-standard doubling of VI (_do_, rather than the bass).

## Leaving out the fifth

When _ti_–_do_ appears in the melody of an authentic cadence involving **V<sup>7</sup>**, it is impossible to fully voice both chords _and_ resolve the functional dissonance.

It is imperative to resolve this functional dissonance, as that resolution is an important contributor to the goal-oriented motion and the releasing of harmonic tension into the cadential arrival. In order to do so, either leave out the fifth of the **I** chord (and triple the bass):

or leave out the fifth of the **V<sup>7</sup>** chord, and double the bass:

The incomplete **V<sup>7</sup>** is preferable to the incomplete **I**, but voice-leading into the **V<sup>7</sup>** will usually dictate which option you choose.

## Leaving out the third

When an **S4** progresses into a **D5**, and both are _seventh chords_, it can be impossible to prepare and resolve the functional dissonances of both chords while fully voicing them.

Instead, leave _la_/_le_ out of the **S4** chord and double the bass. This will retain the trigger and bass note _fa_, as well as the two pitches making the dissonance (_do_ and _re_ or _mi_/_me_ and _fa_), and will allow a second _fa_ in an upper voice that can prepare the seventh of the **D5** chord.
